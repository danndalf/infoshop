blurb: |
  This book is not about collective intelligence as an abstraction, but collective intelligence directed towards a specific end. It attempts to get some traction on difficulties that seem almost impossible to address—dealing with poverty and hunger, corruption and terrorism, climate change and resource shortages—while at the same time building a more livable and less violent world.
