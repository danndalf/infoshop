blurb: |
  This manual provides an introduction to the topic and explains some of the software and methods most often used for circumventing censorship. There is some information on avoiding surveillance and other means of detection while bypassing censorship, however this is a large topic in itself so we have only addressed it where it coincides directly with issues of circumvention.
